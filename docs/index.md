# Overview

Data linkage aims to associate individuals from a data source A are to
individuals from a data source B in a way that global statistics on $A \cup B$
can be discovered and exploited.

Although the library can be used on any data, the original need for data linkage
functionalities comes from a context where data at each source cannot be shared
for legal or competition reasons. Data linkage should therefore be compatible
with anonymized data.

## Scope

The library currently focuses on linkage in the following contexts:

- **There must be some variables in common**. The solutions made available use a
  notion of distance between individuals in both sources. This distance is
  computed using those common variables.
- **Both sources contain data on the same individuals**. Linkage algorithms can
  be adapted to handle linkage of different populations but this is not
  currently done and evaluation on such contexts has not been carried out to
  date.
- Evaluation of the proposed linkage solutions has been carried out on contexts
  with **only 2 data sources**. While handling more data sources by sequentially
  applying linkage is possible, there is no evidence on the quality of the
  resulting linked data.
- Data to be linked is **contained in a single file at each source** where one
  row represents one individual to link. Relational databases are not handled.


## Linkage steps

Data linkage should follow some key steps. First, in most contexts data will
need to be anonymized, so that it can be shared before being linked. It is then
necessary to evaluate the potential for linkage. If the variables common to both
datasets are too few or not representative enough of the datasets, then success
of linkage cannot be guaranteed and it is recommended to look for additional or
alternative common variables before proceeding with linkage. Pre-linkage metrics
are available to measure the chances for a linkage to be successful. Following
computation of pre-linkage metrics, linkage can be performed, resulting in a
single linked data file. When possible (i.e. in experimental or development
contexts), post-linkage metrics can be computed to compare a reference dataset
to the linked data.
